    <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>I am a lover of pets, people, and plants.  I live in Brookfield, IL with
        my familiy, including two dogs and an elderly cat.   
        In case you were wondering, no we cannot hear the lions roar. But we 
        do occasionally hear the wolves.  </p>

        <p>I started my coding journey toward the end of the lockdown, when I took
        an introduction to programming course at my local community college.  I loved
        the challenge and problem solving, something that I'm hoping to continue to
        do in a new career.  </p>
